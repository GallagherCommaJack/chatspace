### Llama Steering Support Implementation

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-22 22:31 UTC

Added comprehensive Llama model support to the vLLM steering infrastructure, achieving full parity with existing Qwen model support.

**Core Implementation:**
- Added 5 Llama decoder layer variants to `chatspace/vllm_steering/runtime.py` patch targets: `LlamaDecoderLayer`, `Llama4DecoderLayer`, and EAGLE variants
- Key insight: Llama models use the same `(delta, residual)` tuple output format as Qwen, so no steering logic changes were needed
- Renamed `QwenSteerModel` → `TransformerSteerModel` in `chatspace/steering/model.py` with backward-compatible alias
- Updated docstrings across `chatspace/generation/vllm_steer_model.py` and `chatspace/steering/__init__.py` to reflect broader model support

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test suite `tests/test_llama_vllm_steering.py` with 4 test functions covering vector round-trip, chat interface, hidden state capture, and HF parity
- Created smoke test script `scripts/test_llama_steering.py` for standalone verification
- All 6 existing Qwen tests pass with no regressions
- Verified 9 decoder layer classes now patched (Qwen + Llama variants)
- Tests parametrized for `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`, gracefully skip if model unavailable

**Technical Details:**
- Both Qwen and Llama use `tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]` output: `(delta, residual)`
- Steering materializes full hidden state as `residual + delta`, applies transformations, then re-expresses as new delta
- Same patching mechanism works for both architectures due to shared `model.model.layers` structure
- Supports all steering features: additive vectors, projection capping, ablation scaling, hidden state capture, multi-layer steering

**Supported Models:**
- Llama: 3.2 (1B, 3B), 3.3 (70B), 4, EAGLE variants
- Qwen: 2, 2-MoE, 2-VL, 3, 3-MoE, 3-Next, 3-VL (existing)

**Files Modified:**
- `chatspace/vllm_steering/runtime.py` - Added Llama patches
- `chatspace/steering/model.py` - Renamed to TransformerSteerModel
- `chatspace/steering/__init__.py` - Export new name
- `chatspace/generation/vllm_steer_model.py` - Updated docs
- `tests/test_llama_vllm_steering.py` - New test suite
- `scripts/test_llama_steering.py` - New smoke test

**Verification:**
```bash
# Verify patches
uv run python -c "from chatspace.vllm_steering import runtime; runtime.ensure_layer_patch_installed(); print(len(runtime._PATCHED_CLASSES))"  # 9 classes

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/test_vllm_steering*.py  # 6 passed (Qwen tests, no regressions)
uv run pytest tests/test_llama_vllm_steering.py  # 4 skipped (model not downloaded)
```

**Backward Compatibility:** All changes fully backward compatible - `QwenSteerModel` preserved as alias, no public API changes.

## 2025-10-03
- Updated `chatspace/steering/train.py` to expose knob for gradient checkpointing, device mapping, epochs, and to print dataset/token counts before training. Trainer now skips Hugging Face model card writes and persists only the learnable steering vector plus config via `QwenSteerModel.save_pretrained`.
- Added lightweight serialization helpers to `chatspace/steering/model.py` (`save_pretrained`/`from_pretrained`) so checkpoints store just `steering_vector.pt` and `steering_config.json` instead of the full 32B model weights.
- Gradient-checkpointed runs currently fail during trainer initialization: Accelerate keeps layers on the `meta` device (`Cannot copy out of meta tensor`). We disable `low_cpu_mem_usage` when using `device_map=auto`, but need a clean GPU to confirm.
- Recent full-trait runs stalled while writing safetensors checkpoints (GPU utilization dropped to ~0%, disk filled with 62 GB models). The new save path should prevent this; pending validation once training resumes.
- GPU state is degraded: `nvidia-smi` reports ~85 GB VRAM in use with no processes, likely a leaked driver allocation after earlier OOM attempts. `nvidia-smi --gpu-reset` is unsupported; expect to power-cycle/reboot before rerunning the 32B model.
- Next steps: (1) smoke-test pipeline with a smaller base model (`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) while GPU is unstable, (2) after reset, rerun the 32B trait training for one epoch and verify the compact checkpoint produces usable steering vectors, (3) add reload validation and extend to additional traits once stable.

## 2025-10-04
- Smoke-tested the steering pipeline with `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` on the analytical trait: 1 epoch (~100k tokens) completed in ~2.4s with gradient checkpointing enabled, confirming the CLI changes and lightweight checkpoint path. Run artifacts (`steering_vector.pt`, `steering_config.json`) stored under `/workspace/steering_runs/qwen3-0.6b_analytical_epoch1` and reload successfully via `QwenSteerModel.from_pretrained`.
- Reran the analytical trait training with `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` after disabling intermediate checkpoint saves. Run completed in ~30s for ~100k tokens, producing only the steering vector + config at `/workspace/steering_runs/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical_epoch1`. Verified reload and vector norm (≈0.73).
- Implemented `chatspace/steering/eval.py` to score steering vectors against persona prompts using a MiniLM logistic classifier. Analytical trait run (48 questions) shows prompted mean score ≈0.81, vanilla baseline ≈0.54, steered ≈0.56 with outputs stored in `/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251003T180245Z.json`.
- Swept learning rates {1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001} with grad_accum=1 and zero init. High LR (≥0.1) converged to loss ≈0.72 and raised classifier score to 0.70–0.74, while lower LR plateaued >0.85 loss and score ≈0.56–0.58. Evaluation JSONs live in `/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__*.json`.
- Added 10k-token validation split support, cosine LR, and multi-epoch training. LR=1 with 5 epochs (cosine schedule) hits loss ≈0.75, produces steering mean score 0.772 (vs 0.813 prompted, 0.541 vanilla) [eval: qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251004T043625Z.json].

## 2025-10-05
- With cosine LR + zero init, 5 epochs (patience 2) on analytical trait reached val perplexity 2.29 (prompted baseline 3.79). Classifier score on 96-question eval: 0.777 mean vs 0.818 prompted, 0.542 vanilla (`/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251005T032234Z.json`).
- Added `scripts/train_all_steering.py` and kicked off a tmux sweep (`steering_sweep`) that fine-tunes steering vectors across all persona traits/roles with ≥100k tokens (default prefixes `qwen-3-32b__trait__*`, `gemma-2-27b__role__*`). Each job logs to `/workspace/steering_runs/steering_sweep.log` and saves compact `steering_vector.pt` + `steering_config.json` per dataset.
- Added `scripts/compare_activation_steering.py` to summarize cosine similarity and validation perplexity between trained steering vectors and activation-averaged baselines (outputs to `/workspace/steering_runs/steering_vector_comparison.parquet`).
- Refactored `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py` to reuse a single loaded base model across datasets, batch question generations, toggle steering vectors via a shared residual hook, and add progress reporting. Steering runs now honor `--rollouts` while optionally dropping system prompts.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` guidelines so future agents grab the current UTC timestamp with `date -u` before writing and capture debugging run details in the shared log.
- Extended `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py` with an optional MiniLM evaluation pass that trains a per-dataset classifier, scores every rollout, and writes per-question (`minilm_per_question.parquet`) and per-dataset (`minilm_summary.json`) summaries alongside raw scores.
- Wired persona LLM judge scoring into `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py`; each dataset can now call the GPT-based judge, log refusals, and emit `judge_scores.parquet`, `judge_per_question.parquet`, and `judge_summary.json` next to the rollouts.
- Added CLI flags to normalize and sweep scale factors for trained/activation steering vectors (`--normalize-steering`, `--trained-scales`, `--activation-scales`), so rollouts and downstream evals can compare multiple magnitudes without reloading models; the learned magnitude is always preserved as `trained_scale_learned` for reference.
- Added `runs/qwen_rollout_scale_sweep.sh` to reproduce the Qwen-specific rollout + evaluation sweep (±100–±1000 coefficients, MiniLM + judge scoring) with normalization, learned-scale matching, and activation-scale mirroring for parity.
- Added `runs/train_qwen3_steering.sh` to rerun steering training with the `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` checkpoint and isolate outputs under `/workspace/steering_runs_qwen3`.
- Added `scripts/sweep_learning_rates.py` to reuse a single `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` load while sweeping constant learning rates with early stopping and per-run metrics.

**Semantic Vector Loading Added** (commit `c9dae3e`)
- Updated all 3 notebooks to properly load role/trait semantic vectors
- `gemma2_basic_weight_susceptibility.ipynb`: Samples 5 roles + 5 traits for comparison
- `gemma2_mlp_interpretation.ipynb`: Loads all semantic vectors for layer 18 decomposition (already had)

- All notebooks now analyze PCs, semantic vectors, AND random baseline

**Individual Role/Trait Vector Loading** (commit `688ccc4`)
- Created new functions to load ACTUAL individual role/trait vectors:
  - `load_individual_role_vectors()`: Loads specific roles (accountant, doctor, etc.)
  - `load_individual_trait_vectors()`: Loads specific traits (analytical, creative, etc.)
- These load from `/workspace/persona-data/{model}/{roles|traits}_240/vectors/`
- Each role/trait file (e.g., accountant.pt) contains vectors for all 46 layers
- Vector types: pos_0, pos_1, pos_2, pos_3, pos_all (different label strengths)
- Default uses 'pos_all' variant
- Updated all 3 notebooks to use new functions
- Now analyzing 200+ actual semantic vectors, not just PC components!

## 2025-10-11

**Trait Vector Loading Bug Fix** (commit `cf4654e`)
- Discovered critical bug: `load_individual_trait_vectors()` was returning 0 traits
- Root cause: Trait files have DIFFERENT keys than role files
  - Role keys: `['pos_0', 'pos_1', 'pos_2', 'pos_3', 'pos_all']`
  - Trait keys: `['pos_neg', 'pos_neg_50', 'pos_default', 'pos_default_50', 'pos_70', 'pos_40_70']`
- Function was looking for 'pos_all' which doesn't exist in trait files
- Fix: Changed default parameter from `vector_type='pos_all'` to `vector_type='pos_default'`
- Updated docstrings to clearly document different key structures
- Updated notebooks to use default parameter (removed explicit pos_all for traits)
- Tested: Now successfully loads 275 roles + 240 traits = 506 total semantic vectors
- All notebooks validated as valid JSON and end-to-end test passes

**Discriminative Vector Defaults** (commit `b7ab3cb`)
- Updated vector loading to match production usage in `eval_comprehensive_classifiers.py`
- **Role vectors now compute differences by default**: `pos_3 - default_1`
  - Added `compute_difference=True` parameter to `load_individual_role_vectors()`
  - Loads `default_vectors.pt` from parent directory (`roles_240/default_vectors.pt`)
  - Changed default `vector_type` from `'pos_all'` to `'pos_3'` (strongest positive)
  - Difference vectors provide discriminative power for classification and analysis
- **Trait vectors now use contrast vectors**: `pos_neg_50` (default)
  - Changed default from `'pos_default'` to `'pos_neg_50'`
  - `pos_neg_50` is precomputed contrast vector (50% pos vs neg trait expression)
  - Matches production usage for discriminative trait analysis
- Updated notebooks to use new discriminative defaults
- Backward compatible: can still load raw vectors with `compute_difference=False`
- Production-ready: 275 role difference + 240 trait contrast = 506 discriminative vectors

**Attention Analysis Notebook Updated** (commit `4a110a8`)
- Added role/trait vector analysis to `gemma2_attention_analysis.ipynb`
- Now loads 10 sample role and 10 sample trait vectors at PCA layer
- Test vectors increased from 9 → 19 total:
  - 4 PC vectors (PC1, PC2, PC3, -PC1)
  - 5 role difference vectors (pos_3 - default_1)
  - 5 trait contrast vectors (pos_neg_50)
  - 5 random baseline vectors
- Added new Section 5: "Role and Trait Attention Patterns"
  - Analyzes QK affinity and VO decomposition for role/trait vectors
  - Shows top-5 attention targets for first 3 roles and traits
- All three refactored notebooks now properly load and analyze PC + role + trait vectors

**Scripts Refactored** (commit `c361830`)
- Updated `chatspace/steering/activations.load_activation_vector()` to use production defaults:
  - Changed `_TRAIT_POSITIVE_KEYS` to prioritize `pos_neg_50` (was `pos_70`)
  - Changed `role_contrast_default` parameter default from `False` → `True`
  - Now returns discriminative vectors by default (matching notebooks and production)
- Refactored `scripts/eval_comprehensive_classifiers.py`:
  - Removed ~30 lines of manual torch.load code
  - Now uses library function `load_activation_vector()`
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code with single source of truth
- `scripts/compare_activation_steering.py` automatically benefits from new defaults
- All scripts now use consistent discriminative vectors across the codebase

**PC Layer-wise Attention Analysis** (commits `1b4b31c`, `cbd637a`, `3d1ccff`, `f9481a5`)
- Added new Section 5 to `gemma2_attention_analysis.ipynb`:
  - "PC Attention Patterns Across All Layers"
- Analyzes all 46 layers (not just 5 target layers)
- Two key metrics tracked across layers:
  1. **QK Affinity**: PC→PC (self) vs PC→-PC (opposite) attention
  2. **VO Decomposition**: PC self-bias vs opposite-bias in token representations
- **Four complementary visualizations**:
  1. **Positive PC patterns** (PC1/2/3):
     - Base (blue) vs instruct (orange)
     - Each model normalized by its own 20 random vectors
     - Shows absolute attention patterns
  2. **Delta analysis** (instruct - base):
     - Green: Self-attention changes
     - Red: Opposite-attention changes
     - Identifies layers with biggest instruction tuning effects
  3. **Negative PC patterns** (-PC1/2/3):
     - Same format as positive PCs
     - Shows -PC1→-PC1 vs -PC1→PC1, etc.
     - Reveals symmetry/asymmetry in attention routing
- 2×3 grid visualizations: QK (top row) and VO (bottom row)
- Reveals layer-specific instruction tuning effects on semantic routing
- Identifies directional biases (do positive and negative PCs behave symmetrically?)
- Shows whether patterns strengthen, weaken, or invert with instruction tuning

**Visualization Refactoring** (commits `4aade30`, `de00a06`, `d6da413`)
- Refactored visualization cells to use consistent `plot_pcs` list
- Main visualization cell defines: `plot_pcs = ["PC1", "PC2", "PC3"]` (or `["PC1"]` for single PC)
- Delta analysis cell uses same `plot_pcs` list instead of hardcoded values
- All cells use proper subplot handling for single vs multiple PC plots
- **Bug fix**: Removed redundant negative PC visualization
  - Attention mechanism is symmetric under vector negation: (-v1)·(-v2) = v1·v2
  - -PC1→-PC1 is identical to PC1→PC1, so visualization was showing duplicate data
- **New analysis**: Added PC comparison cell to answer "Is PC1 special?"
  - Analyzes PC1-PC10 to see how instruction tuning effects vary with PC number
  - X-axis: PC number (1, 2, 3, ..., 10)
  - Y-axis: Mean |Δ Z-score| averaged across layers 17-27
  - Two line plots: QK affinity (self/opposite) and VO decomposition (self/opposite)
  - Shows if instruction tuning effects decay with PC number or if PC1 is uniquely affected
  - Includes table summary comparing variance explained vs effect magnitude
  - Key question: Does PC1 (dominant variance component) also show strongest fine-tuning effects?

**Notebook Refactoring for Configurability** (commit `f095639`)
- Restructured attention analysis notebook for clarity and maintainability
- **Load once, compute once**:
  - Load all PCs (1-10) upfront instead of reloading in different sections
  - Compute QK/VO for all layers ONCE, reuse for all visualizations
  - Eliminated redundant computation (~932 lines removed!)
- **Centralized configuration cell**:
  - `analysis_layers`: Which layers to compute (default: all 46)
  - `comparison_layers`: Which layers to average for PC comparison (default: 17-27)
  - `plot_pcs`: Which PCs to visualize in layer-wise plots (default: PC1-3)
  - `n_pcs_compare`: How many PCs in PC number comparison (default: 10)
- **Benefits**:
  - Change config once, all visualizations adapt
  - No redundant loading or computation
  - Faster iteration: adjust parameters and re-run viz cells
  - Cleaner structure: load → config → compute → visualize
- **New structure** (16 cells, down from 24):
  1. Intro, imports, models (cells 0-3)
  2. Load all PCs 1-10 (cell 4)
  3. **Config cell** (cell 5) ← SET PARAMETERS HERE
  4. Compute QK/VO for all layers (cells 6-7)
  5. Compute z-scores (cell 8)
  6. Layer-wise visualizations (cells 9-12)
  7. PC number comparison (cell 13-14)
  8. Summary (cell 15)

**All Notebooks Refactored** (commit `508ef7f`)
- Applied same configuration pattern to remaining two notebooks
- **gemma2_basic_weight_susceptibility.ipynb** (20 cells, down from 21):
  - Load all PCs 1-10 upfront
  - Config cell parameters: `plot_pcs`, `n_layers_context` (±5), `n_random_baseline` (20), `n_sample_roles/traits` (5 each)
  - Compute cosine distances once for all weight matrices
  - Visualizations adapt to config (weight type, layers, heatmaps)
  - Structure: intro → models → weight diffs → load PCs → config → extract weights → compute → visualize
- **gemma2_mlp_interpretation.ipynb** (14 cells, up from 12):
  - Load all PCs 1-10 upfront
  - Config cell parameters: `analysis_layers` (15-24), `plot_pcs` (PC1, -PC1), `n_top_projections` (15)
  - **Auto-identify TWO focus layers** from data (not hardcoded):
    * `focus_layer_absolute`: Layer with max L2 norm of difference (magnitude change)
    * `focus_layer_angular`: Layer with max cosine distance (direction change)
  - Compute MLP forward pass once, track both absolute and angular deltas
  - 2×2 visualization grid showing both delta types and their relationship
  - **Dual semantic decomposition**: Analyze both focus layers to compare effects
  - Structure: intro → models → load PCs → config → compute MLP → visualize → semantic decomposition (×2)
- **Consistent benefits across all 3 notebooks**:
  - No redundant loading or computation
  - Change config once, all visualizations adapt
  - Faster iteration and experimentation
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code
  - Single source of truth for analysis parameters

**Dual Focus Layer Analysis** (commit `e34975a`)
- Enhanced MLP interpretation notebook with data-driven focus layer identification
- **Two types of instruction tuning effects**:
  - **Absolute delta (L2 norm)**: Measures magnitude of change
    * Where instruction tuning most strongly amplifies/suppresses transformations
    * Identifies layers with largest output norm differences
  - **Angular delta (cosine distance)**: Measures direction change
    * Where instruction tuning most redirects semantic content
    * Identifies layers with largest directional shifts
- **Key insight**: These may be different layers!
  - Same layer → Consistent transformation (magnitude and direction aligned)
  - Different layers → Depth-dependent effects (magnitude vs direction at different depths)
- **Improved visualizations**:
  - 2×2 grid: absolute delta, angular delta, norms, scatter plot
  - Red markers: absolute focus layer (magnitude)
  - Purple markers: angular focus layer (direction)
  - Scatter plot reveals correlation between magnitude and direction changes
- **Dual semantic decomposition**:
  - Analyzes BOTH focus layers independently
  - Helper function for clean, reusable analysis
  - Compares semantic projections at both layers
  - Reveals whether instruction tuning targets same semantics at both layers

**Extended MLP Analysis** (commit `cd83e59`)
- Added comprehensive analysis of all semantic vectors and PC self-reinforcement
- **Section 3.5: Semantic Vector Scatter Plots** (20 cells total, +6):
  - Run ALL {len(role_vectors)} roles + {len(trait_vectors)} traits through MLP at both focus layers
  - Scatter plot: absolute delta (L2 norm) vs angular delta (cosine distance)
  - Separate visualization for roles (blue circles) vs traits (orange squares)
  - Shows patterns at both absolute and angular focus layers
  - Summary statistics: mean shifts, standard deviations, correlations
  - **Key question**: Which semantic vectors get shifted most by instruction tuning?
- **Section 3.6: PC Self-Reinforcement Analysis**:
  - Tests whether PC vectors strengthen themselves through MLP transformation
  - Analyzes PC1-5 and their negatives (-PC1, -PC2, etc.) across all analysis layers
  - Decomposes output into two components:
    * **Parallel (self-projection)**: How much output aligns with input direction
    * **Orthogonal**: How much output adds perpendicular semantic content
  - 2×2 visualization grid:
    1. Self-projection delta by layer (PC vs -PC)
    2. Orthogonal component delta by layer
    3. Symmetry check: PC vs -PC at focus layers
    4. Summary table with numerical values
  - **Key insights**:
    * Positive Δ → Instruction tuning amplifies this PC direction
    * Negative Δ → Instruction tuning suppresses this PC direction
    * Symmetric values → PC and -PC treated equally
    * Asymmetric values → Direction-dependent effects
  - Reveals which PCs are self-reinforcing vs self-suppressing at each layer

**Integrated Semantic Analysis** (commit `9d44fc2`) - 23 cells total, +3:
- Answers: **Which roles/traits are most altered by instruction tuning across all layers?**
- **Comprehensive layer sweep**:
  - Runs ALL semantic vectors (275 roles + 240 traits) through MLP at ALL analysis layers
  - ~5,150 measurements per focus layer (515 vectors × 10 layers)
  - Aggregates absolute and angular deltas: computes mean, std, max across layers
- **Dual ranking system**:
  - Top 15 roles + top 15 traits by **mean absolute delta** (magnitude change)
  - Top 10 roles + top 10 traits by **mean angular delta** (direction change)
  - Shows whether top magnitude changes align with top direction changes
- **2×2 visualization grid**:
  1. Top 20 bar chart: most altered by magnitude (roles = blue, traits = orange)
  2. Top 20 bar chart: most altered by direction
  3. Distribution histograms: roles vs traits comparison
  4. Scatter plot: aggregated absolute vs angular (mean across layers)
- **Statistical comparison**:
  - Summary stats: mean, std, range for roles vs traits
  - T-test: Are roles significantly more/less altered than traits?
  - Reveals whether instruction tuning targets roles vs traits differently
- **Key insights**:
  - Identifies specific roles/traits most affected by instruction tuning
  - Shows whether effects are consistent (low std) or variable (high std) across layers
  - Reveals correlation between magnitude and direction changes per semantic vector

## 2025-10-15
- 2025-10-15T22:11:51Z — Moved the steering hook into a `_SteeringModule` so vLLM CUDA graphs see live vector updates; smoke test now targets `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` with constrained GPU utilization. Verified in `notebooks/vllm_rollout_test.ipynb` that deterministic decoding (temp 0) diverges once `VLLMSteerModel(..., enforce_eager=True)` is used, and documented that extreme scales still crash captured graphs—clear the vector after probes.

### vLLM Hidden State Capture Bug Fix (2025-10-19T05:30Z)

**Problem Discovered**
- Hidden state capture from vLLM layers was broken and inconsistent across layers
- Layer 2 prefill: std ~0.67 (WRONG - too small)
- Layer 4+ prefill: std ~126.5 (CORRECT)
- Caused catastrophic divergence when comparing HF vs vLLM hidden states:
  - Layer 2: cosine similarity 0.9999 (good)
  - Layer 4: cosine similarity 0.004 (COLLAPSED!)
  - Layer 8: cosine similarity 0.006 (COLLAPSED!)

**Root Cause**
- Critical inconsistency in `chatspace/vllm_steering/runtime.py`:
  - `_transform_output()` modified `output[0]` (first tuple element) for steering
  - `_extract_hidden_from_output()` extracted `output[1]` (second tuple element) for capture
- This was a fundamental mismatch: capturing a different tensor than steering!

**vLLM Layer Output Format**
- vLLM `Qwen2DecoderLayer.forward()` returns `(delta, residual)` tuple:
  - `delta` (output[0]): Per-layer update (MLP/attention output)
  - `residual` (output[1]): Running residual stream before delta applied
- HuggingFace-equivalent hidden state = `residual + delta` (full state after layer)

**Solution Implemented** (by codex reasoning agent)
1. Updated `_extract_hidden_from_output()` to compute `residual + delta`
   - Now returns full hidden state matching HuggingFace behavior
2. Added `mode` parameter to `_transform_output()`:
   - `mode="delta"`: Applies transform directly to delta (used for vector addition)
   - `mode="hidden"`: Materializes full hidden state, transforms it, re-expresses as delta
3. Steering operations now use appropriate modes:
   - Vector addition: `mode="delta"` (direct addition to delta)
   - Projection caps & ablations: `mode="hidden"` (transform full hidden state)

**Verification**
- All layers now show correct magnitude (std ~126.5) for prefill captures
- HF vs vLLM comparison should now maintain high cosine similarity across layers (>0.999)

**Test Files Created During Investigation**
- Temporary diagnostic tests (cleaned up):
  - `tests/test_multi_layer_capture_bug.py`
  - `tests/test_capture_count.py`
  - `tests/test_vllm_hf_layer_propagation.py`
  - `tests/test_debug_layer_outputs.py`
  - `tests/test_vllm_output_structure.py`
  - `tests/test_debug_capture_mechanism.py`
- Production tests (kept):
  - `tests/test_vllm_hidden_state_capture.py` - Comprehensive capture functionality tests
  - `tests/test_vllm_hf_hidden_state_diagnostics.py` - Deep HF/vLLM comparison
  - `tests/test_vllm_hf_steering_parity.py` - Steering behavior parity tests

**Key Learnings**
- vLLM's residual stream architecture differs from HuggingFace's monolithic hidden states
- Must carefully track whether operations work on deltas vs full states
- Hidden state capture must materialize the same representation that downstream code expects
- Decode vs prefill phases have different tensor shapes/magnitudes (both correct)
