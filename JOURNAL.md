## 2025-10-03
- Updated `chatspace/steering/train.py` to expose knob for gradient checkpointing, device mapping, epochs, and to print dataset/token counts before training. Trainer now skips Hugging Face model card writes and persists only the learnable steering vector plus config via `QwenSteerModel.save_pretrained`.
- Added lightweight serialization helpers to `chatspace/steering/model.py` (`save_pretrained`/`from_pretrained`) so checkpoints store just `steering_vector.pt` and `steering_config.json` instead of the full 32B model weights.
- Gradient-checkpointed runs currently fail during trainer initialization: Accelerate keeps layers on the `meta` device (`Cannot copy out of meta tensor`). We disable `low_cpu_mem_usage` when using `device_map=auto`, but need a clean GPU to confirm.
- Recent full-trait runs stalled while writing safetensors checkpoints (GPU utilization dropped to ~0%, disk filled with 62 GB models). The new save path should prevent this; pending validation once training resumes.
- GPU state is degraded: `nvidia-smi` reports ~85 GB VRAM in use with no processes, likely a leaked driver allocation after earlier OOM attempts. `nvidia-smi --gpu-reset` is unsupported; expect to power-cycle/reboot before rerunning the 32B model.
- Next steps: (1) smoke-test pipeline with a smaller base model (`Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) while GPU is unstable, (2) after reset, rerun the 32B trait training for one epoch and verify the compact checkpoint produces usable steering vectors, (3) add reload validation and extend to additional traits once stable.

## 2025-10-04
- Smoke-tested the steering pipeline with `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` on the analytical trait: 1 epoch (~100k tokens) completed in ~2.4s with gradient checkpointing enabled, confirming the CLI changes and lightweight checkpoint path. Run artifacts (`steering_vector.pt`, `steering_config.json`) stored under `/workspace/steering_runs/qwen3-0.6b_analytical_epoch1` and reload successfully via `QwenSteerModel.from_pretrained`.
- Reran the analytical trait training with `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` after disabling intermediate checkpoint saves. Run completed in ~30s for ~100k tokens, producing only the steering vector + config at `/workspace/steering_runs/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical_epoch1`. Verified reload and vector norm (≈0.73).
- Implemented `chatspace/steering/eval.py` to score steering vectors against persona prompts using a MiniLM logistic classifier. Analytical trait run (48 questions) shows prompted mean score ≈0.81, vanilla baseline ≈0.54, steered ≈0.56 with outputs stored in `/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251003T180245Z.json`.
- Swept learning rates {1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001} with grad_accum=1 and zero init. High LR (≥0.1) converged to loss ≈0.72 and raised classifier score to 0.70–0.74, while lower LR plateaued >0.85 loss and score ≈0.56–0.58. Evaluation JSONs live in `/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__*.json`.
- Added 10k-token validation split support, cosine LR, and multi-epoch training. LR=1 with 5 epochs (cosine schedule) hits loss ≈0.75, produces steering mean score 0.772 (vs 0.813 prompted, 0.541 vanilla) [eval: qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251004T043625Z.json].

## 2025-10-05
- With cosine LR + zero init, 5 epochs (patience 2) on analytical trait reached val perplexity 2.29 (prompted baseline 3.79). Classifier score on 96-question eval: 0.777 mean vs 0.818 prompted, 0.542 vanilla (`/workspace/steering_evals/qwen-3-32b__trait__analytical__20251005T032234Z.json`).
- Added `scripts/train_all_steering.py` and kicked off a tmux sweep (`steering_sweep`) that fine-tunes steering vectors across all persona traits/roles with ≥100k tokens (default prefixes `qwen-3-32b__trait__*`, `gemma-2-27b__role__*`). Each job logs to `/workspace/steering_runs/steering_sweep.log` and saves compact `steering_vector.pt` + `steering_config.json` per dataset.
- Added `scripts/compare_activation_steering.py` to summarize cosine similarity and validation perplexity between trained steering vectors and activation-averaged baselines (outputs to `/workspace/steering_runs/steering_vector_comparison.parquet`).
- Refactored `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py` to reuse a single loaded base model across datasets, batch question generations, toggle steering vectors via a shared residual hook, and add progress reporting. Steering runs now honor `--rollouts` while optionally dropping system prompts.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` guidelines so future agents grab the current UTC timestamp with `date -u` before writing and capture debugging run details in the shared log.
- Extended `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py` with an optional MiniLM evaluation pass that trains a per-dataset classifier, scores every rollout, and writes per-question (`minilm_per_question.parquet`) and per-dataset (`minilm_summary.json`) summaries alongside raw scores.
- Wired persona LLM judge scoring into `scripts/generate_behavior_rollouts.py`; each dataset can now call the GPT-based judge, log refusals, and emit `judge_scores.parquet`, `judge_per_question.parquet`, and `judge_summary.json` next to the rollouts.
- Added CLI flags to normalize and sweep scale factors for trained/activation steering vectors (`--normalize-steering`, `--trained-scales`, `--activation-scales`), so rollouts and downstream evals can compare multiple magnitudes without reloading models; the learned magnitude is always preserved as `trained_scale_learned` for reference.
- Added `runs/qwen_rollout_scale_sweep.sh` to reproduce the Qwen-specific rollout + evaluation sweep (±100–±1000 coefficients, MiniLM + judge scoring) with normalization, learned-scale matching, and activation-scale mirroring for parity.
- Added `runs/train_qwen3_steering.sh` to rerun steering training with the `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` checkpoint and isolate outputs under `/workspace/steering_runs_qwen3`.
- Added `scripts/sweep_learning_rates.py` to reuse a single `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` load while sweeping constant learning rates with early stopping and per-run metrics.

**Semantic Vector Loading Added** (commit `c9dae3e`)
- Updated all 3 notebooks to properly load role/trait semantic vectors
- `gemma2_basic_weight_susceptibility.ipynb`: Samples 5 roles + 5 traits for comparison
- `gemma2_mlp_interpretation.ipynb`: Loads all semantic vectors for layer 18 decomposition (already had)
- `gemma2_attention_analysis.ipynb`: Includes all semantic vectors in QK/VO analysis (already had)
- All notebooks now analyze PCs, semantic vectors, AND random baseline

**Individual Role/Trait Vector Loading** (commit `688ccc4`)
- Created new functions to load ACTUAL individual role/trait vectors:
  - `load_individual_role_vectors()`: Loads specific roles (accountant, doctor, etc.)
  - `load_individual_trait_vectors()`: Loads specific traits (analytical, creative, etc.)
- These load from `/workspace/persona-data/{model}/{roles|traits}_240/vectors/`
- Each role/trait file (e.g., accountant.pt) contains vectors for all 46 layers
- Vector types: pos_0, pos_1, pos_2, pos_3, pos_all (different label strengths)
- Default uses 'pos_all' variant
- Updated all 3 notebooks to use new functions
- Now analyzing 200+ actual semantic vectors, not just PC components!

## 2025-10-11

**Trait Vector Loading Bug Fix** (commit `cf4654e`)
- Discovered critical bug: `load_individual_trait_vectors()` was returning 0 traits
- Root cause: Trait files have DIFFERENT keys than role files
  - Role keys: `['pos_0', 'pos_1', 'pos_2', 'pos_3', 'pos_all']`
  - Trait keys: `['pos_neg', 'pos_neg_50', 'pos_default', 'pos_default_50', 'pos_70', 'pos_40_70']`
- Function was looking for 'pos_all' which doesn't exist in trait files
- Fix: Changed default parameter from `vector_type='pos_all'` to `vector_type='pos_default'`
- Updated docstrings to clearly document different key structures
- Updated notebooks to use default parameter (removed explicit pos_all for traits)
- Tested: Now successfully loads 275 roles + 240 traits = 506 total semantic vectors
- All notebooks validated as valid JSON and end-to-end test passes

**Discriminative Vector Defaults** (commit `b7ab3cb`)
- Updated vector loading to match production usage in `eval_comprehensive_classifiers.py`
- **Role vectors now compute differences by default**: `pos_3 - default_1`
  - Added `compute_difference=True` parameter to `load_individual_role_vectors()`
  - Loads `default_vectors.pt` from parent directory (`roles_240/default_vectors.pt`)
  - Changed default `vector_type` from `'pos_all'` to `'pos_3'` (strongest positive)
  - Difference vectors provide discriminative power for classification and analysis
- **Trait vectors now use contrast vectors**: `pos_neg_50` (default)
  - Changed default from `'pos_default'` to `'pos_neg_50'`
  - `pos_neg_50` is precomputed contrast vector (50% pos vs neg trait expression)
  - Matches production usage for discriminative trait analysis
- Updated notebooks to use new discriminative defaults
- Backward compatible: can still load raw vectors with `compute_difference=False`
- Production-ready: 275 role difference + 240 trait contrast = 506 discriminative vectors

**Attention Analysis Notebook Updated** (commit `4a110a8`)
- Added role/trait vector analysis to `gemma2_attention_analysis.ipynb`
- Now loads 10 sample role and 10 sample trait vectors at PCA layer
- Test vectors increased from 9 → 19 total:
  - 4 PC vectors (PC1, PC2, PC3, -PC1)
  - 5 role difference vectors (pos_3 - default_1)
  - 5 trait contrast vectors (pos_neg_50)
  - 5 random baseline vectors
- Added new Section 5: "Role and Trait Attention Patterns"
  - Analyzes QK affinity and VO decomposition for role/trait vectors
  - Shows top-5 attention targets for first 3 roles and traits
- All three refactored notebooks now properly load and analyze PC + role + trait vectors

**Scripts Refactored** (commit `c361830`)
- Updated `chatspace/steering/activations.load_activation_vector()` to use production defaults:
  - Changed `_TRAIT_POSITIVE_KEYS` to prioritize `pos_neg_50` (was `pos_70`)
  - Changed `role_contrast_default` parameter default from `False` → `True`
  - Now returns discriminative vectors by default (matching notebooks and production)
- Refactored `scripts/eval_comprehensive_classifiers.py`:
  - Removed ~30 lines of manual torch.load code
  - Now uses library function `load_activation_vector()`
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code with single source of truth
- `scripts/compare_activation_steering.py` automatically benefits from new defaults
- All scripts now use consistent discriminative vectors across the codebase

**PC Layer-wise Attention Analysis** (commits `1b4b31c`, `cbd637a`, `3d1ccff`, `f9481a5`)
- Added new Section 5 to `gemma2_attention_analysis.ipynb`:
  - "PC Attention Patterns Across All Layers"
- Analyzes all 46 layers (not just 5 target layers)
- Two key metrics tracked across layers:
  1. **QK Affinity**: PC→PC (self) vs PC→-PC (opposite) attention
  2. **VO Decomposition**: PC self-bias vs opposite-bias in token representations
- **Four complementary visualizations**:
  1. **Positive PC patterns** (PC1/2/3):
     - Base (blue) vs instruct (orange)
     - Each model normalized by its own 20 random vectors
     - Shows absolute attention patterns
  2. **Delta analysis** (instruct - base):
     - Green: Self-attention changes
     - Red: Opposite-attention changes
     - Identifies layers with biggest instruction tuning effects
  3. **Negative PC patterns** (-PC1/2/3):
     - Same format as positive PCs
     - Shows -PC1→-PC1 vs -PC1→PC1, etc.
     - Reveals symmetry/asymmetry in attention routing
- 2×3 grid visualizations: QK (top row) and VO (bottom row)
- Reveals layer-specific instruction tuning effects on semantic routing
- Identifies directional biases (do positive and negative PCs behave symmetrically?)
- Shows whether patterns strengthen, weaken, or invert with instruction tuning

**Visualization Refactoring** (commit `4aade30`)
- Refactored all three visualization cells to use consistent `plot_pcs` list
- Main visualization cell defines: `plot_pcs = ["PC1", "PC2", "PC3"]` (or `["PC1"]` for single PC)
- Delta analysis cell now uses same `plot_pcs` list instead of hardcoded values
- Negative PC visualization builds `plot_neg_pairs` dynamically from `plot_pcs`
- All cells use proper subplot handling:
  - Single PC: `ax = axes[0]` (1D indexing)
  - Multiple PCs: `ax = axes[0, i]` (2D indexing)
- User can now change PC selection once and all visualizations adapt automatically
- Consistent pattern across positive PC, delta, and negative PC analyses
