# Capture Hook Optimization - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Branch:** `optimize-capture-hotpath`
**Status:** ✅ READY TO MERGE

## Problem

Original capture code showed catastrophic performance degradation:
- **+133% generation overhead** for all-layer capture vs baseline
- **+97% degradation** from iteration 1 to iteration 3 within same run
- Root cause: 147,456 `torch.cat()` operations per generation (one per decode token per layer per batch item)

## Solution

Five key optimizations:
1. Dictionary lookup caching
2. Remove debug logging overhead
3. Boolean phase checks
4. Direct hook calls
5. **Decode buffer batching** (batch 32 tokens before concatenation)

## Results

### Performance Improvement
- **51% faster:** 85.26s → 41.79s mean generation time
- **2.04x speedup** for all-layer capture

### Eliminated Degradation
- **Before:** 57s → 85s → 113s (+97%)
- **After:** 41.6s → 42.4s → 41.3s (+1.8%)

### Production-Ready Overhead
- **All-layer (36) overhead:** +14.4% vs baseline (was +133%)
- **Per-layer cost:** ~0.4% (was ~2.6%)
- **Zero-layer overhead:** +1.9% (metadata only)

### Tested
✅ Comprehensive integration test passes (30s)
✅ Isolated benchmark validates all configurations
✅ No regressions in capture functionality

- `c5544fb`: Hook hot-path optimizations (dict lookups, logging)
- `938ca89`: Decode buffer batching (main optimization)
- `4d20a8c`: State migration fix
- `952cac6`: Documentation

## Recommendation

**MERGE TO MAIN.** The optimizations provide substantial performance improvements with no functional regressions. The decode buffer batching eliminates the critical degradation issue while maintaining correctness.

## Future Work

Optional further optimizations (low priority):
1. Pre-allocation of full decode buffers (requires max_tokens knowledge)
2. CUDA stream optimization for async transfers
3. Investigate GPU memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead

Current performance is acceptable for production use.
